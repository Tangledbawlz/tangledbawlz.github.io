    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>As the Co-Owner of "House Of MotorZ", we have decided that our purpose is to have a company that is ethical and has a set of rules that
         follows the rules of the road, but still enjoying the love and thrill of racing on the tracks. We also produce clothing merchandise for
        a reasonable price, with creative and unique emblems. 
        <br>We hope you enjoy</p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p> 
        This company is for anyone who loves cars, and you can add your own logo! Although the company explicitly uses car designs,
         it is possible to pay a few extra dollars to add a design of your choice, that is NOT copyright claimed, to a sticker or a 
         piece of clothing.

You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->
